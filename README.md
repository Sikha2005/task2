EDA Summary Write-up 

Findings:

The dataset contains X rows and Y columns.

The mean, median, and standard deviation values help understand feature spread.

Histograms showed some features are right/left-skewed.

Boxplots revealed several outliers in features like XYZ.

The correlation matrix identified strong positive/negative correlations between A and B.

No missing values (after earlier cleaning).

No duplicated rows detected.


Insights:

Features with high skewness may require normalization or log transformation.

Strongly correlated features may cause multicollinearity in modeling.

Outliers may need to be handled depending on model sensitivity.
